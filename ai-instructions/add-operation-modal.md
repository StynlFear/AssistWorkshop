You should add the modal for adding an agent to the agents page. The modal should include fields for the agent name, description, and any necessary parameters. Ensure that the modal is styled consistently with the rest of the application and that it includes validation for required fields. The modal should also have a submit button that triggers the creation of the agent and closes the modal upon successful submission.
use the same styling and structure as the styles in the application. The modal should be accessible and user-friendly, allowing users to easily add new agents to the system. Make sure to test the modal functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
There is already a button on the main page you only need to add the modal functionality and ensure it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase. The modal should be triggered by the button click and should handle both opening and closing states appropriately.
connect it to the api database to ensure that the new agent is saved correctly. Use the existing API endpoints for agent creation if available, or create a new endpoint if necessary. Ensure that the modal handles any errors gracefully and provides feedback to the user upon successful creation of an agent.
